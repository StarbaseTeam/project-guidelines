<a name="understanding-requirements"></a>

## 1. Understanding Requirements and Tech Analysis

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

This phase is the cornerstone of any successful project. Our goal is to deeply understand the client's needs and identify the key tasks that
need to be addressed. We actively engage with stakeholders to gather all necessary requirements and clarify expectations. Based on the
gathered information, we conduct a detailed analysis of tasks and technologies that we plan to use. This allows us to avoid potential
misunderstandings, ensure technical compatibility, and successfully achieve the set goals.

<a name="task-organization"></a>

## 2. Task Organization in Jira: Creation and Estimation

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

At this stage, we move on to the detailed organization of the project in Jira. The created task board serves as our primary management tool.
Each task is clearly defined and assigned a specific goal. By evaluating each task, we develop a detailed work plan, optimize resource
allocation, and mitigate risks.

Depending on the specifics of the project, we apply various project management methodologies:

* Waterfall: A sequential approach, ideal for projects with well-defined requirements.
* Agile: A flexible methodology that allows for adaptation to changes throughout the development process.
* Kanban: A visual method that helps optimize workflows and ensure even team loading.
* Scrum: An iterative approach with short development cycles (sprints), providing high flexibility and adaptability.

By choosing the most suitable methodology, we ensure effective project management, process transparency, and timely achievement of our
goals.

## 3. Git

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

<a name="some-git-rules"></a>

### 3.1 Some Git rules

There are a set of rules to keep in mind:

- **Perform work in a feature branch.**

  > This approach ensures that all work is performed in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch. It allows you to submit
  multiple pull requests without causing confusion and enables you to iterate without contaminating the master branch with potentially
  unstable or incomplete code. [read more...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

- **Branch out from `develop`**

  > This ensures that the code in the master branch is consistently buildable and mostly release-ready, though this might be excessive for
  smaller projects.

- **Never push into `develop` or `master` branch. Make a Pull Request.**

  > It informs the team of a feature's completion, enables peer review, and offers a designated area for discussing the feature.

- **Always update your local `develop` branch to the latest version and do an interactive rebase before submitting a Pull Request.**

  > Rebasing will merge the requested branch (`develop` or `master`) into your local branch and apply your local commits to the top of the
  history without creating a merge commit (assuming there are no conflicts). This results in a clean and linear
  history. [read more ...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)

- **Resolve potential conflicts while rebasing and before making a Pull Request.**
- **Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.**
- **Use [this](./.gitignore) `.gitignore` file.**

  > It includes a predefined list of system files that should be excluded from remote repositories. Additionally, it excludes settings
  folders and files for popular editors and common dependency folders.

<a name="git-workflow"></a>

### 3.2 Git workflow

We use [Feature-branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)
with [Interactive Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing) and some elements
of [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) (naming and having a develop branch). The main
steps are as follows:

<a name="writing-good-commit-messages"></a>

### 3.3 Writing good commit messages

A clear commit guideline can significantly improve your Git workflow and collaboration with others. Here are some rules of
thumb ([source](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)):

- **Keep subject lines under 50 characters and wrap the body text at 72 characters.**

  > Commits should be granular and focused, with concise descriptions.

- **Do not end the subject line with a period.**
- **Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ as opposed to _how_.**

<a name="coding-standards"></a>

## 4. Coding Standards

Filenames containing multiple words **SHOULD** be joined with [dashes (hyphens), not underscores][-_].

Image files **SHOULD** be descriptively named. (eg. `empire-state-building.jpg` not `bldg-1.jpg`)

<a name="code-style"></a>

## 5. Code style

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

In our project, it's essential to adhere to a consistent coding style to ensure high code readability and maintainability. We follow the
Airbnb coding style as a standard for writing clean and maintainable code. Please adhere to the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, which
includes:

- Clear structure and code formatting.
- Use of modern ES6+ syntax.
- Consistency in variable and function naming.
- Avoidance of unused code and logical duplicates.
- Strict type control and the use of explicit checks.

The Airbnb code style documentation helps prevent common errors and enhances teamwork on the project. Please review the full
guide [here][airbnb-codstyle].

<a name="environments"></a>

## 6. Environments

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

In our project, we use three main environments: Development (Dev), User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and Production (Prod). Each of these
environments has its own role and purpose:

* **Development**

> (Dev): an environment for active development, where experiments are conducted, new features are added, and changes are made to the code.

* **User Acceptance Testing**

> (UAT): an environment for reviewing and testing functionality, where users can evaluate and approve changes before release.

* **Production**

> (Prod): the final environment, where the application is used by real users in a live setting. All changes to production must undergo
> thorough testing and approval.

This clear separation of environments helps minimize risks and ensures stability and control over releases.

<a name="testing"></a>

## 7. Testing

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

Testing is an essential part of development aimed at ensuring the quality and stability of the code. In our project, we focus on several key
types of testing:

* **Smoke Testing**

> Checks the basic functionality of the system to ensure that the application works and is ready for further testing. This type
> of testing is conducted early to catch any critical issues.

* **Feature Testing**

> Verifies new or modified functionality to ensure that it works as per the requirements. Each new feature undergoes thorough
> testing at all levels.

* **Regression Testing**

> Ensures that the system functions correctly after changes are made, and that no previously working functionality is
> broken. Regression helps prevent errors caused by recent updates.

An important part of the testing process is creating test cases. Each test case should be described as a scenario that covers various use
cases, including both positive and negative scenarios. This helps ensure maximum test coverage and increases the likelihood of finding bugs.

## 8. Tools

![Understanding Requirements](/images/branching.png)

The use of tools plays a crucial role in the efficient development and maintenance of the project. They help automate processes, increase
productivity, track progress, and resolve issues at every stage of development. It is essential for each team member to use the approved
tools to ensure consistency and quality of work.
